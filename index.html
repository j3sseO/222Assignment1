                <h2>What is HTTP and HTTPS?</h2>
                <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the web. HTTP provides
                    communication between different communcation systems. When a user makes an
                    HTTP request on their browser, the server sends the data that was requested
                    to the user in the form of a webpage. This means that the HTTP protocol provides
                    us with a means of transferring data from a server to a client.
                </p>
                <p>So what is HTTPS?</p>
                <p>The main different between the two is the additional feature of security.
                    HTTPS implements this security feature using a SSL certificate. The use of HTTPS
                    is mainly required in situations such as entering bank account details. To provide
                    encryption, HTTPS uses an encryption protocol known as Transport Layer Security,
                    officially referred to as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
                </p>
                <p>The SSL protocol enctrypts the data which the client transmits to the server.
                    This means that if any information was to be stolen while in transit between
                    a client and a server, the person who stole the information wouldn't be able
                    to understand the content due to the encryption.
