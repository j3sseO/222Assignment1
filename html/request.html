                <h2>What is a request?</h2>
                <p>
                    A request or HTTP request is made by a client, to the server hosting the webpage. The purpose of the request
                    is to access resources to load the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A request to a server must include components of a URL. which contains the information needed to access
                    the resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A HTTP request contains the following elements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A request line.</li>
                    <li>A series of HTTP headers or header fields.</li>
                    <li>A message body, if requred.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Request Line</h3>
                <p>
                    The request line is the first line in the HTTP request. It consists of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <!-- Uses span tag to bold text -->
                    <li>
                        1. A <span class="bold">method</span>. The method is one word that tells the server what to do with the resource.
                        Some examples of HTTP methods are <span class="bold">GET, HEAD, POST, PUT</span>, and some others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. The URL (path) for the request. The URL tells the server where the resource is stored.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3. The HTTP version number. This tells the server what HTTP version the request is in.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <code>GET /images/screamingpig.png HTTP/1.1</code>
                <p>
                    Above is an example of of a request line.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses the GET method</li>
                    <li>The path to the resource is <span class="bold">/images/screamingpig.png</span>.</li>
                    <li>Use the HTTP version HTTP/1.1</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>HTTP Header</h3>
                <p>
                    An HTTP header are used in an HTTP request to provide the server with information about the request,
                    where it came from, and how communication should continue. A HTTP header is made up of a name and a value.
                    The HTTP protocol specifications define the standard set of HTTP headers, and describes how to use them correctly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Message Body</h3>
                <p>
                    Essentially, the message body is the actual content of the message. Message bodies are only required for some request
                    methods and not others. For example, a request using the POST method, which sends input data to the server, has to have
                    a message body containing the input data. However, a request that uses the GET method, which is requesting a resource,
                    doesn't need to have a message body.
